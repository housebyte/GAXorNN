SA Mediated Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for Neural Network Topology

GA Xor NN - This is a Simulated Annealed Genetic Algorithm being run on multiple threads solve two objective functions.

The first is the Schaefer Function and the second is the Parameters (Weights) and Topology (Connections) for a simple Multi Layered Percpetron (MLP) that solves the XoR problem.

Its an interesting project that I found quite rewarding and shows that you can combine Heuristics like the Simulated Annealing with a Genetic Algorithm for Building a functioning Neural Network.

It is based on Pthreads and is not GPU based.

Could be a useful tool. Or used as a resource for buillding something similar.
